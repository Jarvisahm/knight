"""
This is because A cannot say "I am a knave" because a knave doesn't tell the truth and a knight doesn't lie.
And the opposite is true: A said "I am a knight," but B said "A said 'I am a knave.'" So B is a knave and anything he says is false.
Therefore, C is a knight and anything he says is true. This ensures that A said "I am a knight" and he is a knight according to C.
The Biconditional(AKnight, AKnave) explains the situation: it is impossible for A to say "I am a knight" and be lying, and also impossible for A to say "I am a knave" and be telling the truth.
So, A cannot be both a knight and a knave at the same time, which is represented by Biconditional(AKnight, AKnave).
